# Simple neural network

Implementation of a simple feedforward neural net.

Goal of this project is to learn the basics of neural network through a real
example.

## Dataset
I've used the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset for this neural network.

## Results

### Results with batch size = 1

| Epochs | Iterations | Hidden Layers | Precision on the Test set [%] |Learning Rate|
|--------|------------|---------------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| 8      | 535000     | 200           | 94.3                          |0.001        |

### Results with SGD, minibatch size = 200
